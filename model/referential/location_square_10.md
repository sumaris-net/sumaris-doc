## Codification of cell 10' of latitude x 10' of longitude

The codification of each 10'x10' cell is based on the geographical position of this cell on the globe and is
composed by three elements:

1. The first element corresponds to the quadrant which is the quarter of the globe compared to equator and
Greenwich meridian. 4 values are possible:
  * 1: Northwest quadrant (positive latitude, negative longitude)
  * 2: Northeast quadrant (positive latitude, positive longitude)
  * 3: Southeast quadrant (negative latitude, positive longitude)
  * 4: Southwest quadrant (negative latitude, negative longitude)

Example: the cell # 1 425 0013 is in the quadrant 1 (Northwest quadrant).
In the context of our study Area, the unique case figure is the Northwest quadrant = 1.

Each cell is defined by a reference point depending on the quadrant. For the Northwest quadrant, the
reference point is the lowest and easternmost of the cell.

2. The second one corresponds to the latitude of the reference point of the cell (three following figures of
the code)

The latitude is coded by 3 characters. The first two correspond to the latitude degree (between 0 and 90°)
and the last character corresponds to the tens of minutes (from 0 to 5) of the reference point.
In the example, 425 corresponds to 42 ° 50 '.

3. The third element concerns the longitude of the reference point of the cell (three following figures)

The longitude is coded by 4 characters. The third part of the code correspond to the longitude degree
(between 0 and 180°) and the last character corresponds to the tens of minutes (from 0 to 5) of the
reference point.

In the example, 0013 is 1 ° 30 '.

For the example, the 10 '*10' cell # 1 425 0013 is in the quadrant 1 and the reference point of this cell -the
lowest and the easternmost- is the position 42 ° 50 'N, 1 ° 30' W.
