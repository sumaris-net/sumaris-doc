## Quality control

<u>Controling a sample of input forms is important to control how it matches with the declared value</u>:
Each one has to control on his own side because it’s the first phase of the validation.

Selecting 10% of the total data entered, and then verify the entry.
If an error is found, please correct these data and then randomly pull an additional form for control.
If there are no errors on the record, continue the entry.

<u>Interpretation of the information th   at fail to fulfil  the way to complete the forms</u>:
Sometimes   information   does   not   comply   with   the   protocol’s   recommendations   and   requires
interpretation in order to be entered.

For example, the listed target species is a commercial species (sole SOL) and not one of the 18 pre-
defined groups on page 4 of the forms corresponding to European categories for level 5 métiers.
The data grabber considers the sole SOL like a " demersal fish” DEF and proceed to the correction
on the forms.

These checks can be done before the entry. They speed up the entry time.

<u>Input controls available in the input tool</u>:
Some controls are already automatic. Others will be added in future versions.
- Control of the start and end date of trip: an end date can never be more recent than a start 
trip date.
- Control the start and end dates of a fishing operation: idem
- Control of Date/Time Format: Hours are limited by entries from 00 to 23h. Minutes are 
limited by entries from 00 to 59 minutes. Days cannot exceed 31 days and 12 months, for 
months.
- Control of minimum and maximum values for specific fields.
- Control over the number of decimals allowed.

<u>Comments</u>:
